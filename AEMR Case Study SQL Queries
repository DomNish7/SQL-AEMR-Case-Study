--Question 1.1: Statement to retrieve count of valid outage events in 2016
--Grouped/Ordered by outage reason

--Solution 1.1:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events,
       Status,
       Reason
  FROM AEMR
 WHERE Status = 'Approved' AND Year(Start_Time) = 2016
 GROUP BY Reason 
 ORDER BY Reason;

--Solutaion 1.3:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events,
       Status,
       Reason
  FROM AEMR
 WHERE Status = 'Approved' AND Year(Start_Time) = 2017
 GROUP BY Reason 
 ORDER BY Reason;
 
 --Solution 1.5:
 SELECT Status,
       Reason,
       COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events,
       ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, Start_Time, End_Time)/1440), 2) AS
       Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Days,
       YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year
  FROM AEMR
 WHERE Status= 'Approved'
 GROUP BY Status, Reason, YEAR(Start_Time)
 ORDER BY YEAR(Start_Time), Reason;
 
 --Solution: 2.1:
 SELECT Status,
       Reason,
       COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events,
       MONTH(Start_Time) AS Month
  FROM AEMR
 WHERE Status= 'Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time) = 2016
 GROUP BY Status, Reason, Month
 ORDER BY Month, Reason;
 
 --Solution 2.2:
 SELECT Status,
       Reason,
       COUNT(*) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events,
       MONTH(Start_Time) AS Month
 FROM AEMR
 WHERE Status= 'Approved' AND YEAR(Start_Time) = 2017
 GROUP BY Status, Reason, Month
 ORDER BY Month, Reason;
 
 --Solution 2.3:
